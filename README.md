# DiMotif
Alignment-free Protein Motif Miner -- the software instruction will be released soon.

## Computational Workflow

<ul>
<li>For a given set of positive sequences it extracts the most discriminative motifs in the positive class using a probabilistic segmentation inferred from Swiss-Prot</li>
<li>Motifs are hierarchically clustered according to their co-occurence patterns in the positive sequences
Motifs are colored according to their most frequent secondary structure in PDB database</li>
<li>For each motif the normalized biophysical scores are also provided for further biophysical interpretations</li>
<li>The orange databases in the diagram are general-purpose databases and information. However, the red and blue databases are problem-specific datasets we want to find their related motifs.</li>
<ul>
